# Digital Audio Signal Processing

In this section, we transition into concepts that are at the foundation of digital audio signal processing. We'll demonstrate several useful techniques along the way to manipulate audio signals, estimate and extract information from audio signals, create interesting audio effects, and more...

This section is in progress... and I plan to put several of [these](https://github.com/randyaliased/acs-sp-demos) up here. 

For now, this section contains a few of the notebooks I use to teach the [Audio Signal Processing and Synthesis](https://catalogue.surrey.ac.uk/2025-6/module/TON2022) module at the University of Surrey.

# Welcome to this space

_This is the first page the student will see when opening the url._

Welcome... in case you randomly stumble across this page, there's a lot of updating going on here... These are a bunch of interactive jupyter notebooks for understanding audio analysis, processing, and synthesis. Slowly putting them all up here... feel free to look around, but no guarantees of anything properly working/accurate. But soon! Feel free to get in touch - r.ali@surrey.ac.uk
